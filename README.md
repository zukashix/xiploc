# Mirada XipLoc
XipLoc is a command-line based script written in python 3 to encrypt folders with several layers of security. All you need is a password and remember it.

## Usage
**Windows:** Download a .exe build from releases and run `xiploc.exe --help` on command line for help.<br />
**Linux/Mac/Other:** Install `pyzipper` and `cryptography` modules through pip or your package manager and run the script `python3 xiploc.py --help`.

## How does it work?
The script locks your folder with a random password encrypted zip that even you won't know. This zip is encrypted once more as a binary file and broken into several small random chunks which are almost impossible to distinguish. The data required to unlock these chunks is hidden in another file encrypted by a key generated by a password only you will remember!
